## Win Ratio: Definitions and Properties

The win ratio (WR) is a pairwise, nonparametric method for comparing composite outcomes in a prioritized manner. Each subject in the treatment arm is compared to each subject in the control arm over a shared follow-up window. A win is declared if the treated subject experiences a better outcome—typically defined as longer survival or, if tied on survival, fewer or later nonfatal events.

Formally, let $D_i^{(a)}, T_i^{(a)}, C_i^{(a)}$ denote survival, hospitalization, censoring times on $i$th subject in group $a$ $(i=1,\ldots, N_a; a= 1, 0)$.
Then the win fraction for group $a$ versus $1-a$ is
$$
\hat w^{(a, 1-a)} = \frac{1}{N_1N_0} \sum_{i=1}^{N_a} \sum_{j=1}^{N_{1-a}} \hat w^{(a, 1-a)}_{ij},
$$
where 
\begin{align}
            \hat w^{(a, 1-a)}_{ij}&= \underbrace{I(D_j^{(1-a)}< D_i^{(a)}\wedge C_i^{(a)}\wedge C_j^{(1-a)})}_{\mbox{win on survival}}\\
            & + \underbrace{I(\min(D_i^{(a)}, D_j^{(1-a)}) > C_i^{(a)}\wedge C_j^{(1-a)}, T_j^{(1-a)}< T_i^{(a)}\wedge C_i^{(1)}\wedge C_j^{(0)})}_{\mbox{tie on survival, win on hospitalization}}
    \end{align}


The win ratio statistic is defined as
$$
\text{WR} = \frac{\hat w^{(1, 0)}}{\hat w^{(0, 1)}}.
$$

Alternative summaries include the **net benefit** (proportion in favor) and the **win odds**, which account for ties and interpret the WR on a log-odds scale. In the special case of binary outcomes, the WR reduces to the odds ratio, and the net benefit corresponds to the risk difference.

## Hypothesis Testing and Interpretation

Statistical inference for the WR is based on the asymptotic normality of the log win ratio:
$$
S_n = \frac{\sqrt{n} \log(\hat w_{1,0} / \hat w_{0,1})}{\hat{\rm SE}} \sim N(0, 1),
$$
under the null hypothesis that treatment and control are equally effective. The standard error $\hat{\rm SE}$ is calculated via $U$-statistics, and the null corresponds to equal bivariate survival functions $H^{(1)}(s, t) = H^{(0)}(s, t)$ for all $t \le s$.

The alternative hypothesis assumes that the probability of a treatment win exceeds that of a control win at all times. A sufficient condition is that the joint distribution of death and nonfatal events under treatment is stochastically larger than under control.

## Extensions and Variants

Several extensions of the WR improve its flexibility and robustness. Weighted comparisons allow later follow-up times to contribute more to the test statistic, leading to log-rank-type weights. Stratified WR methods compare subjects within strata to adjust for confounding and increase efficiency.

## Generalization to Recurrent Events

When subjects experience multiple nonfatal events, a generalized WR can be defined using a win function $\mathcal{W}(\cdot, \cdot)(t)$ that compares event histories up to time $t$. The generalized win ratio statistic becomes
$$
\hat{\mathcal E}_n(\mathcal W) = \frac{\sum \mathcal W(\mathcal H^{*(1)}_i, \mathcal H^{*(0)}_j)}
     {\sum \mathcal W(\mathcal H^{*(0)}_j, \mathcal H^{*(1)}_i)},
$$
where comparisons are made up to the minimum of each pair’s observed follow-up time.

Three versions of recurrent-event win functions are commonly used:

- **Naive WR**: prioritize death, then total number of events
- **First-event WR**: further prioritize time to first event
- **Last-event WR**: further prioritize time to last event

All versions enforce a win/loss/tie rule based on observable history, and guarantee that win status is unchanged after death. Among them, the last-event WR (LWR) has shown superior power in simulation studies due to fewer ties and better separation between subjects.

## HF-ACTION Example

In the HF-ACTION trial, recurrent-event WR methods were applied to a high-risk subgroup of 426 patients. Compared to usual care, exercise training reduced both mortality and hospitalizations. The last-event WR was estimated as 1.32 (95% CI: 1.05–1.66, *p* = 0.019), with similar results from first-event and naive WRs.

![](images/test_hfaction_wr.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

These results illustrate that recurrent-event WRs detect benefits more effectively than traditional time-to-first-event WRs, especially when the number and timing of nonfatal events vary widely across subjects.

## Sample Size Calculation

Sample size calculation for WR is based on a joint model for death and nonfatal events. Under a Gumbel–Hougaard copula model, the joint survival function is
$$
        \pr(D^\a>s, T_1^\a>t) = \exp\left(-\left[\{\exp(a\xi_D)\lambda_Ds\}^\kappa + \{\exp(a\xi_H)\lambda_Ht\}^\kappa \right]^{1/\kappa}\right)
$$
where $\lambda_D^a$ and $\lambda_H^a$ are arm-specific baseline hazard rates and $\kappa$ controls the dependence between outcomes.

The required sample size is
$$
n = \frac{\zeta_0^2(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\gamma)^2}{q(1-q)\delta^\top \xi},
$$
where:

- $\zeta_0^2$ is the variance of the test statistic under the null,
- $\delta$ is the sensitivity of the log-WR to changes in log-HRs $\xi$,
- $q$ is the treatment allocation proportion.

Design parameters include the accrual duration $\tau_b$, total follow-up time $\tau$, and a random loss-to-follow-up rate $\lambda_L$.

## HF-ACTION: Planning a New Trial

Using HF-ACTION training arm data as historical reference, the estimated baseline rates were:

- $\lambda_D = 0.073$ deaths/year
- $\lambda_H = 0.56$ hospitalizations/year
- Kendall’s correlation = 36.1%

Assuming HRs of 0.9 (death) and 0.8 (hospitalization), and minimal loss to follow-up, the sample size required for 80% power is approximately $n = 1241$.

## Example R code

The following example uses a data frame `df` in long format with columns:

-   `id`: subject identifier\
-   `time`: event or censoring time\
-   `status`: event type (0 = censoring, 1 = death, 2 = nonfatal)\
-   `trt`: treatment group (0 = control, 1 = treatment)\
-   `strata`: optional stratification variable

```{r}
#| eval: false
########################################
# 1. WR test for recurrent events
########################################
library(WR)

obj <- WRrec(ID = df$id, time = df$time, status = df$status, 
             trt = df$trt, strata = df$strata, naive = TRUE)

# Extract log win ratio and standard error
obj$log.WR
obj$se
print(obj)


########################################
# 2. Sample size calculation
########################################
# Step 1: Estimate baseline outcome parameters
base_est <- gumbel.est(id = df$id, time = df$time, status = df$status)

# Step 2: Design-specific noise and signal
bparam <- base(lambda_D = base_est$lambda_D,
               lambda_H = base_est$lambda_H,
               kappa = base_est$kappa,
               tau_c = 3, tau = 4, lambda_L = 0.001)

# Step 3: Required sample size for given effect sizes
WRSS(xi = log(c(0.9, 0.8)), bparam = bparam, q = 0.5, power = 0.8)$n

```

## Conclusion

The win ratio test provides a clinically meaningful and statistically valid method for analyzing prioritized composite outcomes. By extending to recurrent events and general win functions, the WR accommodates complex patient trajectories while preserving interpretability. Among several extensions, the last-event WR offers strong separation and improved power in trials with repeated nonfatal events.

Sample size formulas grounded in copula models enable principled trial design. The WR package supports both estimation and power analysis, facilitating the broader adoption of win-based strategies in modern clinical research.
